# NOTE: I was not able to get the build to work
# using conda-provided compilers. Doing so led
# to strange behavior with CMake's library resolution where it
# would refuse to use system-provided OpenGL headers when
# compiling Irrlicht no matter how hard I tried.
# And unfortunately there is no OpenGL implementation in conda.
