Luanti is a voxel-based game platform with multiplayer capabilities.

The objective in the games available varies, from sandbox games where you can explore, dig and build in a very large voxel world, to arcade style games made with the engine.

There are a wide range of built-in map generators for procedually generated terrain, and voxel-based lighting that adjusts after the environment and light sources.

All games and mods are written in Lua using the scripting API which is easy to use and get started with for modders.

Luanti is available for Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, and Android.
